# PHP üêò

## Installation

Install the php formula with Homebrew.

```
brew install php
```

Start PHP background service

```
brew services start php
```

## Configuration

Open `/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` in your favourite editor.

Find and replace configs:

Insert after the last LoadModule (probably mod_rewrite.so):

```
LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so
```

Change `DirectoryIndex index.html` to `DirectoryIndex index.php index.html`

Insert after the previously edited `DirectoryIndex` area and before the htaccess/htpasswd `IfModule` area:

```
<FilesMatch \.php$>
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

Restart your Apache server...

```
sudo apachectl restart
```

Cowabunga! The latest PHP version is now installed and ready to use. Go to your Sites directory and add a info.php file with `<?php phpinfo();` in it and open it in your browser via [http://localhost/phpinfo.php](http://localhost/phpinfo.php).

What‚Äôs next? In my next tutorial ‚ÄúInstall and run multiple PHP versions with Homebrew‚Äù you can learn how to install multiple PHP versions and run different versions on different vHosts at the same time.
