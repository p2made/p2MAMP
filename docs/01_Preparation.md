# 1 Preparation

Create a Sites folder in your home directory. This folder will later be our document root, where we place our HTML and PHP files.

```
mkdir ~/Sites
```

Also, create a simple index.html file so we can later test if our apache configurations are working.

```
echo "Hello from Sites" > ~/Sites/index.html
```

Type...

```
whoami
```

... into your terminal and it will return your username, we need to now that and will use it later.
