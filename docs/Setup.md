# Setup Local (L)AMP Stack on Mac with Homebrew

I know, there are plenty of tutorials around on how to set up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on Mac with Homebrew but in this one, I‚Äôll try to keep it short and sweet.

## Before we start

### Requirements

- üíª macOS
- üç∫ [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

### Preparation

Create a Sites folder in your home directory. This folder will later be our document root, where we place our HTML and PHP files.

```
mkdir ~/Sites
```

Also, create a simple index.html file so we can later test if our apache configurations are working.

```
echo "Hello from Sites" >~/Sites/index.html
```

Type...

```
whoami
```

... into your terminal and it will return your username, we need to now that and will use it later.

## A for Apache ü¶Ö

### Installation

Stop and unload the mac system build in apache

```
sudo apachectl stop
sudo launchctl unload -w /Systems/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist

```

Install the [httpd formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/httpd) with Homebrew (V2.4.37) (*httpd* is the same as *Apache2*)

```
brew install httpd
```

Start background service and start Apache

```
brew services start httpd
sudo apachectl start
```

When opening now [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) you should see ‚Äú**It works!**‚Äù

### Configuration

Open in your favourite editor the file `/usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf`
Find and replace configs:

`from` | `to`
------ | ----
`Listen 8080` | `Listen 80`
`DocumentRoot "/usr/local/var/www"` | `DocumentRoot "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites"`
`<Directory "/usr/local/var/www">` | `<Directory "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites">`
`AllowOverride None` * | `AllowOverride All `
`#LoadModule rewrite_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_rewrite.so` | `LoadModule rewrite_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_rewrite.so `
`User _www ` | `User YOUR_USERNAME `
`Group _www ` | `Group staff `
`#ServerName www.example.com:8080` | `ServerName localhost:80 `

\* Inside the previously edited `‚Äú<Directory ‚Äú/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites‚Äù>‚Äù`

Yeehaw! Apache is now installed and configured. After saving your changes in the httpd.conf file you need to restart your apache server with `sudo apachectl restart`. After that you can open [http://localhost](http://localhost) and should see the documents from your Sites directory.

What‚Äôs next? In my next tutorial ‚Äú[Create vHosts for multiple local URLs with Homebrew Apache2/httpd](https://medium.com/@JanFaessler/create-vhosts-for-multiple-local-urls-with-homebrew-apache2-httpd-97d4ec59e125)‚Äù you can learn more about how to create multiple local URLs with different document roots.

## P for PHP üêò

### Installation

Install the php formula with Homebrew. (V7.2.12)

```
brew install php
```

Start PHP background service

```
brew services start php
```

Configuration
Open in your favourite editor the file /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Find and replace configs:

Insert after the last LoadModule (probably mod_rewrite.so):

```
LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so
```

Change `DirectoryIndex index.html` to `DirectoryIndex index.php index.html`

Insert after the previously edited `DirectoryIndex` area and before the htaccess/htpasswd `IfModule` area:

```
<FilesMatch \.php$>
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

Restart your Apache server...

```
sudo apachectl restart
```

Cowabunga! The latest PHP version is now installed and ready to use. Go to your Sites directory and add a info.php file with `<?php phpinfo();` in it and open it in your browser via [http://localhost/phpinfo.php](http://localhost/phpinfo.php).

What‚Äôs next? In my next tutorial ‚ÄúInstall and run multiple PHP versions with Homebrew‚Äù you can learn how to install multiple PHP versions and run different versions on different vHosts at the same time.

## M for MySQL üê¨

### Installation

Install the mysql formula with Homebrew. (V8.0.12)


```
brew install mysql
```

Start the Homebrew MySQL daemon

```
brew services start mysql

```

### Configuration

Run...

```
mysql_secure_installation
```

... to start configuring MySQL

Now go through the procedure and set the configs as required.

I suggest this config:
```

‚ÄúWould you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?‚Äù: n
‚Äúpassword for root‚Äù: 1234
‚ÄúRemove anonymous users?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúDisallow root login remotely?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúRemove test database and access to it?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúReload privilege tables now?‚Äù: y
```

Hurray! MySQL is now installed and configured. You can start, stop and restart it with the Homebrew services command like this: $ brew services start|stop|restart mysql. If you‚Äôd like to test to connect PHP with your MySQL you can do it like described on this [W3Schools Site](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp).

What‚Äôs next? In my next tutorial ‚ÄúConnect MySQL to phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro‚Äù you can learn more about how to set up and connect phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro to your MySQL.

### Links to configs

At this point, I recommend creating short links inside your Sites directory to the different config files and folders of your (L)AMP stack.

Create new etc folder inside your Sites directory

```
mkdir /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc

```

Apache

```
ln -s /usr/local/etc/httpd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/httpd
```

MySQL

```
ln -s /usr/local/etc/my.cnf /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/my.cnf
```

PHP
```

ln -s /usr/local/etc/php/7.2 /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/php72
```

### There is more

Like mentioned after each chapter I‚Äôve made tutorials on how to improve the current state, it will be most comfortable going through them in this order:

* [Create vHosts for multiple local URLs with Homebrew Apache2/httpd](./vHosts.md)
* Coming soon: Install and run multiple PHP versions with Homebrew
* Coming soon: Connect MySQL to phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro
