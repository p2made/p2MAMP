# 4 MySQL üê¨

## Installation

Install the mysql formula with Homebrew. (V8.0.12)


```
brew install mysql
```

Start the Homebrew MySQL daemon

```
brew services start mysql

```

### Configuration

Run...

```
mysql_secure_installation
```

... to start configuring MySQL

Now go through the procedure and set the configs as required.

I suggest this config:
```

‚ÄúWould you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?‚Äù: n
‚Äúpassword for root‚Äù: 1234
‚ÄúRemove anonymous users?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúDisallow root login remotely?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúRemove test database and access to it?‚Äù: y
‚ÄúReload privilege tables now?‚Äù: y
```

Hurray! MySQL is now installed and configured. You can start, stop and restart it with the Homebrew services command like this: $ brew services start|stop|restart mysql. If you‚Äôd like to test to connect PHP with your MySQL you can do it like described on this [W3Schools Site](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp).

What‚Äôs next? In my next tutorial ‚ÄúConnect MySQL to phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro‚Äù you can learn more about how to set up and connect phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro to your MySQL.

### Links to configs

At this point, I recommend creating short links inside your Sites directory to the different config files and folders of your (L)AMP stack.

Create new etc folder inside your Sites directory

```
mkdir /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc

```

Apache

```
ln -s /usr/local/etc/httpd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/httpd
```

MySQL

```
ln -s /usr/local/etc/my.cnf /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/my.cnf
```

PHP
```

ln -s /usr/local/etc/php/7.2 /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Sites/etc/php72
```


[http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/)

### There is more

Like mentioned after each chapter I‚Äôve made tutorials on how to improve the current state, it will be most comfortable going through them in this order:

* [Create vHosts for multiple local URLs with Homebrew Apache2/httpd](./vHosts.md)
* Coming soon: Install and run multiple PHP versions with Homebrew
* Coming soon: Connect MySQL to phpMyAdmin or Sequel Pro
